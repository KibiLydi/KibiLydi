This is a college assignment account for Lydia Clark. My major is in computer science.

Projects I'm looking forward to: 

I'm enrolled in both CEG 2350 and CEG 3310 this semester. In both of these classes, we are apparently going to learn about assembly, with 3310 teaching us LC-3 assembly. It's probably a bit weird, but I'm super excited for this! My interest in computer science came from examining old video games, which were usually programmed in assembly, so I already have some basic knowledge on the subject, and might even be more adaptable to it because I have this background. (When we learned Java in 1180, I was very suprised when I learned that we were expected to use ints to store ANY whole number. Older games were usually programmed to save space by using the shortest bit size that was necessary for that variable, so numbers could be stored as 8-bit, or 16-bit, or could be unsigned, etc. It felt so wrong to use a 32-bit data type to store things that could easily fit in something much smaller than that! It's so wasteful...) I'm also excited about this because, even if I'm not learning a very useful type of assembly, I'll be able to apply the concepts from LC-3 to ARM assembly or similar. This means that I may be able to modify or even make games that were designed for older hardware. It would be very satisfying to be able to go deeper into the subject that made me interested in programming in the first place!

I'm also in CS3900, where we're learning concepts related to a development pipeline within a corporate setting. Frankly, the more corporate concepts are not very interesting to me, although they are important to learn. What interests me about the class are the topics related to containerizing, UI design, database management, and version control with things like git (which I am also learning in CEG2350). I've been introduced into the concept of containers before, but haven't quite been able to grasp them, so it's very exciting to me that I'll finally understand them. I also already learned about SQL databases last semester, so I'm hoping I can use that knowledge in the class and hopefully go into more detail about database programming in general. Overall, the goal is to work with other classmates to create a fully-featured web app from the ground up, which will be a very valuable experience that'll be helpful for creating more user-friendly, good-looking, functioning programs in the future. ...Oh, and, uh, learning to work together with a team to make a plan and a program and such. Even if that's boring for me, it's probably one of the most important skills in the field, so I'll definitely benefit from it.
